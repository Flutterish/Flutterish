### [I'm porting osu!lazer to VR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ndww1yVhXI)
You could call this my biggest project. I coded up a whole 3D physics and rendering engine just for this one. It extends osu!framework to work in 3 dimensions, as well as XR. I plan to make it open source within the next 2 releases.

### I'm experimenting with making an operating system in Zig
This is my "learning project" for Zig and a step into understanding bare metal architecture. Currently, it is mostly a copy of zig zen.

### I'm designing a programming language
Codename `role` is a general purpose systems programming language designed around data and its interpretation. It allows for compile time code evaluation and emmision and unlike most languages it does not discern between primitive and composite values, instead it treats everything as bits which you can designate to "mean" something via roles - descriptions of which bits have what name and their role.

### [I'm remastering Hitokori](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiYi1VLhHvQ)
Hitokori is a clone of `A dance of Fire and Ice` for osu!. I'm working to make it as extensible as possible. I am also making a visual editor for it.
