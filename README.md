# Flutterish
I'm a half-blood furry, programmist and a failed artist who has no idea what they are doing.
I love pink (half of my personality), vengence and defiance of existence itself.

My current project is porting [osu!lazer to VR.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buh7JBEfMFc)
I'm also fiddling with making an operating system in Zig.
